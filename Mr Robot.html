Mr. Robot follows Elliot, a young programmer who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and a vigilante hacker by night.<br>
Elliot finds himself at a crossroad when the mysterious leader of an underground hacker group recruits him to destroy the corporation he is paid to protect.<br>
- Written by USA<br>
</p>
	
<p style="text-align: left; font-family: arial; color: white;">Elliot's internal struggles surrounding his upbringing and personal life intertwine with his present external challenges as part of fsociety. Being very introverted Elliot fails to express emotions and determine for himself what is real and what is not, a question that is also left somewhat ambiguous to the viewer. In particular Elliot struggles to remember important facts about his close relatives.</p>


<p style="text-align: left; font-family: arial; color: white;">Eventually with the hard work of fsociety (it's hard to know exactly to what extent Elliot is himself wholly fsociety, but the group certainly appears to be ultimately based mainly around Elliot and his sister, Darlene), and with help from other hackers in China, the large scale hack on Evil Corp is carried out successfully and all debt data held by the giant corporation is lost.</p> <br> <br>
